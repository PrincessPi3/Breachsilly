sort then split! # literally fucking must do this to have any god damned chance

    # also prepends da 0x remov
    awk '{val="0x" $1; print strtonum(val),$0 ;}' your_file | sort -n -k 1 | sed 's/^[^ ]* //'

    # another option
    ## does this assume 0x??
    paste -d: <(echo 'ibase=16'; cut -d' ' -f1 your_file | bc) your_file | sort -t: -k1,1n | cut -d: -f2-

    # opttion?
    ## prepend 0x to each line?
    ## -g is GENRAL numerical sort and it can handle hex nativelu
    ## does not work will have to prepend 0x
    sort -o outfilename -g filename
